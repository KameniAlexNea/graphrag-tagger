To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we\\npropose GraphRAG, a graph-based approach to question answering over private\\ntext corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity\\nof source text. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph index in two stages:\\nfirst, to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pre-\\ngenerate community summaries for all groups of closely related entities. Given a\\nquestion, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before\\nall partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a\\nclass of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range,\\nwe show that GraphRAG leads to substantial improvements over a conventional\\nRAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers.\\n1\\nIntroduction\\nRetrieval augmented generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) is an established approach to using', 'Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) (Lewis et al., 2020) is an established approach to using\\nLLMs to answer queries based on data that is too large to contain in a language model’s context\\nwindow, meaning the maximum number of tokens (units of text) that can be processed by the LLM\\nat once (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023).

This conventional approach, which we collectively call\\nvector RAG, works well for queries that can be answered with information localized within a small\\nset of records. However, vector RAG approaches do not support sensemaking queries, meaning\\nqueries that require global understanding of the entire dataset, such as ”What are the key trends in\\nhow scientific discoveries are influenced by interdisciplinary research over the past decade?”\\nSensemaking tasks require reasoning over “connections (which can be among people, places, and\\nevents) in order to anticipate their trajectories and act effectively” (Klein et al., 2006). LLMs such\\nas GPT (Achiam et al., 2023; Brown et al., 2020), Llama (Touvron et al., 2023), and Gemini (Anil\\net al., 2023) excel at sensemaking in complex domains like scientific discovery (Microsoft, 2023)', 'et al., 2023) excel at sensemaking in complex domains like scientific discovery (Microsoft, 2023)\\nand intelligence analysis (Ranade and Joshi, 2023). Given a sensemaking query and a text with an\\nimplicit and interconnected set of concepts, an LLM can generate a summary that answers the query.\\nThe challenge, however, arises when the volume of data requires a RAG approach, since vector RAG\\napproaches are unable to support sensemaking over an entire corpus.\\nIn this paper, we present GraphRAG – a graph-based RAG approach that enables sensemaking over\\nthe entirety of a large text corpus. GraphRAG first uses an LLM to construct a knowledge graph,\\nwhere nodes correspond to key entities in the corpus and edges represent relationships between those\\nentities. Next, it partitions the graph into a hierarchy of communities of closely related entities,\\nbefore using an LLM to generate community-level summaries. These summaries are generated in\\na bottom-up manner following the hierarchical structure of extracted communities, with summaries\\nat higher levels of the hierarchy recursively incorporating lower-level summaries. Together, these\\ncommunity summaries provide global descriptions and insights over the corpus. Finally, GraphRAG', 'community summaries provide global descriptions and insights over the corpus. Finally, GraphRAG\\nanswers queries through map-reduce processing of community summaries; in the map step, the\\nsummaries are used to provide partial answers to the query independently and in parallel, then in the\\nreduce step, the partial answers are combined and used to generate a final global answer.\\nThe GraphRAG method and its ability to perform global sensemaking over an entire corpus form\\nthe main contribution of this work. To demonstrate this ability, we developed a novel application\\nof the LLM-as-a-judge technique (Zheng et al., 2024) suitable for questions targeting broad issues\\nand themes where there is no ground-truth answer. This approach first uses one LLM to generate\\na diverse set of global sensemaking questions based on corpus-specific use cases, before using a\\nsecond LLM to judge the answers of two different RAG systems using predefined criteria (defined\\nin Section 3.3). We use this approach to compare GraphRAG to vector RAG on two representative\\nreal-world text datasets. Results show GraphRAG strongly outperforms vector RAG when using\\nGPT-4 as the LLM.', 'GPT-4 as the LLM.\\nGraphRAG is available as open-source software at https://github.com/microsoft/graphrag. In ad-\\ndition, versions of the GraphRAG approach are also available as extensions to multiple open-\\nsource libraries, including LangChain (LangChain, 2024), LlamaIndex (LlamaIndex, 2024), Nebu-\\nlaGraph (NebulaGraph, 2024), and Neo4J (Neo4J, 2024).\\n2\\nBackground\\n2.1\\nRAG Approaches and Systems\\nRAG generally refers to any system where a user query is used to retrieve relevant information from\\nexternal data sources, whereupon this information is incorporated into the generation of a response\\nto the query by an LLM (or other generative AI model, such as a multi-media model). The query and\\nretrieved records populate a prompt template, which is then passed to the LLM (Ram et al., 2023).\\nRAG is ideal when the total number of records in a data source is too large to include in a single', 'RAG is ideal when the total number of records in a data source is too large to include in a single\\nprompt to the LLM, i.e. the amount of text in the data source exceeds the LLM’s context window.\\nIn canonical RAG approaches, the retrieval process returns a set number of records that are seman-\\ntically similar to the query and the generated answer uses only the information in those retrieved\\nrecords. A common approach to conventional RAG is to use text embeddings, retrieving records\\nclosest to the query in vector space where closeness corresponds to semantic similarity (Gao et al.,\\n2023). While some RAG approaches may use alternative retrieval mechanisms, we collectively refer\\nto the family of conventional approaches as vector RAG. GraphRAG contrasts with vector RAG in\\nits ability to answer queries that require global sensemaking over the entire data corpus.\\n2', 'GraphRAG builds upon prior work on advanced RAG strategies. GraphRAG leverages summaries\\nover large sections of the data source as a form of ”self-memory” (described in Cheng et al. 2024),\\nwhich are later used to answer queries as in Mao et al. 2020). These summaries are generated in\\nparallel and iteratively aggregated into global summaries, similar to prior techniques (Feng et al.,\\n2023; Gao et al., 2023; Khattab et al., 2022; Shao et al., 2023; Su et al., 2020; Trivedi et al., 2022;\\nWang et al., 2024). In particular, GraphRAG is similar to other approaches that use hierarchical\\nindexing to create summaries (similar to Kim et al. 2023; Sarthi et al. 2024). GraphRAG contrasts\\nwith these approaches by generating a graph index from the source data, then applying graph-based\\ncommunity detection to create a thematic partitioning of the data.\\n2.2\\nUsing Knowledge Graphs with LLMs and RAG', '2.2\\nUsing Knowledge Graphs with LLMs and RAG\\nApproaches to knowledge graph extraction from natural language text corpora include rule-\\nmatching, statistical pattern recognition, clustering, and embeddings (Etzioni et al., 2004; Kim et al.,\\n2016; Mooney and Bunescu, 2005; Yates et al., 2007). GraphRAG falls into a more recent body of\\nresearch that use of LLMs for knowledge graph extraction (Ban et al., 2023; Melnyk et al., 2022;\\nOpenAI, 2023; Tan et al., 2017; Trajanoska et al., 2023; Yao et al., 2023; Yates et al., 2007; Zhang\\net al., 2024a). It also adds to a growing body of RAG approaches that use a knowledge graph as\\nan index (Gao et al., 2023). Some techniques use subgraphs, elements of the graph, or properties\\nof the graph structure directly in the prompt (Baek et al., 2023; He et al., 2024; Zhang, 2023)', 'or as factual grounding for generated outputs (Kang et al., 2023; Ranade and Joshi, 2023). Other\\ntechniques (Wang et al., 2023b) use the knowledge graph to enhance retrieval, where at query time\\nan LLM-based agent dynamically traverses a graph with nodes representing document elements\\n(e.g., passages, tables) and edges encoding lexical and semantical similarity or structural relation-\\nships. GraphRAG contrasts with these approaches by focusing on a previously unexplored quality of\\ngraphs in this context: their inherent modularity (Newman, 2006) and the ability to partition graphs\\ninto nested modular communities of closely related nodes (e.g., Louvain, Blondel et al. 2008; Lei-\\nden, Traag et al. 2019). Specifically, GraphRAG recursively creates increasingly global summaries\\nby using the LLM to create summaries spanning this community hierarchy.\\n2.3\\nAdaptive benchmarking for RAG Evaluation\\nMany benchmark datasets for open-domain question answering exist, including HotPotQA (Yang', 'Many benchmark datasets for open-domain question answering exist, including HotPotQA (Yang\\net al., 2018), MultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024), and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024). However,\\nthese benchmarks are oriented towards vector RAG performance, i.e., they evaluate performance\\non explicit fact retrieval. In this work, we propose an approach for generating a set of questions\\nfor evaluating global sensemaking over the entirety of the corpus. Our approach is related to LLM\\nmethods that use a corpus to generate questions whose answers would be summaries of the corpus,\\nsuch as in Xu and Lapata (2021). However, in order to produce a fair evaluation, our method avoids\\ngenerating the questions directly from the corpus itself (as an alternative implementation, one can\\nuse a subset of the corpus held out from subsequent graph extraction and answer evaluation steps).\\nAdaptive benchmarking refers to the process of dynamically generating evaluation benchmarks tai-\\nlored to specific domains or use cases. Recent work has used LLMs for adaptive benchmarking\\nto ensure relevance, diversity, and alignment with the target application or task (Yuan et al., 2024;', 'to ensure relevance, diversity, and alignment with the target application or task (Yuan et al., 2024;\\nZhang et al., 2024b). In this work, we propose an adaptive benchmarking approach to generating\\nglobal sensemaking queries for the LLM. Our approach builds on prior work in LLM-based persona\\ngeneration, where the LLM is used to generate diverse and authentic sets of personas (Kosinski,\\n2024; Salminen et al., 2024; Shin et al., 2024). Our adaptive benchmarking procedure uses persona\\ngeneration to create queries that are representative of real-world RAG system usage. Specifically,\\nour approach uses the LLM to infer the potential users would use the RAG system and their use\\ncases, which guide the generation of corpus-specific sensemaking queries.\\n2.4\\nRAG evaluation criteria\\nOur evaluation relies on the LLM to evaluate how well the RAG system answers the generated ques-\\ntions. Prior work has shown LLMs to be good evaluators of natural language generation, includ-\\ning work where LLMs evaluations were competitive with human evaluations (Wang et al., 2023a;', 'ing work where LLMs evaluations were competitive with human evaluations (Wang et al., 2023a;\\nZheng et al., 2024).

Lacking a gold standard for evaluation, one can\\nquantify relative performance for a given criterion by prompting the LLM to compare generations\\nfrom two different competing models (LLM-as-a-judge, (Zheng et al., 2024)). In this work, we de-\\nsign criteria for evaluating RAG-generated answers to global sensemaking questions and evaluate\\nour results using the comparative approach. We also validate results using statistics derived from\\nLLM-extracted statements of verifiable facts, or “claims.”\\n3\\nMethods\\n3.1\\nGraphRAG Workflow\\nFigure 1 illustrates the high-level data flow of the GraphRAG approach and pipeline. In this section,\\nwe describe the key design parameters, techniques, and implementation details for each step.\\n3.1.1\\nSource Documents →Text Chunks', '3.1.1\\nSource Documents →Text Chunks\\nTo start, the documents in the corpus are split into text chunks. The LLM extracts information from\\neach chunk for downstream processing. Selecting the size of the chunk is a fundamental design\\ndecision; longer text chunks require fewer LLM calls for such extraction (which reduces cost) but\\nsuffer from degraded recall of information that appears early in the chunk (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu\\net al., 2023). See Section A.1 for prompts and examples of the recall-precision trade-offs.\\n3.1.2\\nText Chunks →Entities & Relationships\\nIn this step, the LLM is prompted to extract instances of important entities and the relationships\\nbetween the entities from a given chunk. Additionally, the LLM generates short descriptions for the\\nentities and relationships. To illustrate, suppose a chunk contained the following text:\\n4', 'NeoChip’s (NC) shares surged in their first week of trading on the NewTech Ex-\\nchange.

Claims are important\\nfactual statements about entities, such as dates, events, and interactions with other entities. As\\nwith entities and relationships, in-context learning exemplars can provide domain-specific guidance.\\nClaim descriptions extracted from the example tetx chunk are as follows:\\n• NeoChip’s shares surged during their first week of trading on the NewTech Exchange.\\n• NeoChip debuted as a publicly listed company on the NewTech Exchange.\\n• Quantum Systems acquired NeoChip in 2016 and held ownership until NeoChip went pub-\\nlic.\\nSee Appendix A for prompts and details on our implementation of entity and claim extraction.\\n3.1.3\\nEntities & Relationships →Knowledge Graph\\nThe use of an LLM to extract entities, relationships, and claims is a form of abstractive summariza-\\ntion – these are meaningful summaries of concepts that, in the case of relationships and claims, may', 'tion – these are meaningful summaries of concepts that, in the case of relationships and claims, may\\nnot be explicitly stated in the text. The entity/relationship/claim extraction processes creates mul-\\ntiple instances of a single element because an element is typically detected and extracted multiple\\ntimes across documents.\\nIn the final step of the knowledge graph extraction process, these instances of entities and rela-\\ntionships become individual nodes and edges in the graph. Entity descriptions are aggregated and\\nsummarized for each node and edge. Relationships are aggregated into graph edges, where the num-\\nber of duplicates for a given relationship becomes edge weights. Claims are aggregated similarly.\\nIn this manuscript, our analysis uses exact string matching for entity matching – the task of reconcil-\\ning different extracted names for the same entity (Barlaug and Gulla, 2021; Christen and Christen,\\n2012; Elmagarmid et al., 2006). However, softer matching approaches can be used with minor ad-\\njustments to prompts or code.

These summaries are independently useful as a\\nway to understand the global structure and semantics of the dataset, and may themselves be used to\\nmake sense of a corpus in the absence of a specific query. For example, a user may scan through\\ncommunity summaries at one level looking for general themes of interest, then read linked reports\\nat a lower level that provide additional details for each subtopic. Here, however, we focus on their\\nutility as part of a graph-based index used for answering global queries.\\nGraphRAG generates community summaries by adding various element summaries (for nodes,\\nedges, and related claims) to a community summary template. Community summaries from lower-\\nlevel communities are used to generate summaries for higher-level communities as follows:', 'level communities are used to generate summaries for higher-level communities as follows:\\n• Leaf-level communities. The element summaries of a leaf-level community are prioritized\\nand then iteratively added to the LLM context window until the token limit is reached.\\nThe prioritization is as follows: for each community edge in decreasing order of combined\\nsource and target node degree (i.e., overall prominence), add descriptions of the source\\nnode, target node, the edge itself, and related claims.\\n• Higher-level communities. If all element summaries fit within the token limit of the con-\\ntext window, proceed as for leaf-level communities and summarize all element summaries\\nwithin the community. Otherwise, rank sub-communities in decreasing order of element\\nsummary tokens and iteratively substitute sub-community summaries (shorter) for their\\nassociated element summaries (longer) until they fit within the context window.\\n3.1.6\\nCommunity Summaries →Community Answers →Global Answer\\nGiven a user query, the community summaries generated in the previous step can be used to generate\\na final answer in a multi-stage process.

Community summaries are randomly shuffled and divided\\ninto chunks of pre-specified token size. This ensures relevant information is distributed\\nacross chunks, rather than concentrated (and potentially lost) in a single context window.\\n• Map community answers.

Both kinds of element\\ninstance are output in a single list of delimited tuples.\\nA.2\\nSelf-Reflection\\nThe choice of prompt engineering techniques has a strong impact on the quality of knowledge graph\\nextraction (Zhu et al., 2024), and different techniques have different costs in terms of tokens con-\\nsumed and generated by the model. Self-reflection is a prompt engineering technique where the\\nLLM generates an answer, and is then prompted to evaluate its output for correctness, clarity, or\\ncompleteness, then finally generate an improved response based on that evaluation (Huang et al.,', 'completeness, then finally generate an improved response based on that evaluation (Huang et al.,\\n2023; Madaan et al., 2024; Shinn et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2022). We leverage self-reflection in\\nknowledge graph extraction, and explore ways how removing self-reflection affects performance\\nand cost.\\nUsing larger chunk size is less costly in terms of calls to the LLM. However, the LLM tends to\\nextract few entities from chunks of larger size. For example, in a sample dataset (HotPotQA, Yang\\net al., 2018), GPT-4 extracted almost twice as many entity references when the chunk size was 600\\ntokens than when it was 2400. To address this issue, we deploy a self-reflection prompt engineering\\napproach. After entities are extracted from a chunk, we provide the extracted entities back to the\\nLLM, prompting it to “glean” any entities that it may have missed. This is a multi-stage process\\nin which we first ask the LLM to assess whether all entities were extracted, using a logit bias of', 'in which we first ask the LLM to assess whether all entities were extracted, using a logit bias of\\n100 to force a yes/no decision. If the LLM responds that entities were missed, then a continuation\\nindicating that “MANY entities were missed in the last extraction” encourages the LLM to detect\\nthese missing entities. This approach allows us to use larger chunk sizes without a drop in quality\\n(Figure 3) or the forced introduction of noise. We interate self-reflection steps up to a specified\\nmaximum number of times.\\n0\\n1\\n2\\n3\\n0\\n10000\\n20000\\n30000\\nNumber of self-reflection iterations performed\\nEntity references detected\\n600 chunk size\\n1200 chunk size\\n2400 chunk size\\nFigure 3: How the entity references detected in the HotPotQA dataset (Yang et al., 2018)\\nvaries with chunk size and self-reflection iterations for our generic entity extraction prompt with\\ngpt-4-turbo.\\nB\\nExample Community Detection\\n18', '(a) Root communities at level 0\\n(b) Sub-communities at level 1\\nFigure 4: Graph communities detected using the Leiden algorithm (Traag et al., 2019) over the\\nMultiHop-RAG (Tang and Yang, 2024) dataset as indexed. Circles represent entity nodes with size\\nproportional to their degree. Node layout was performed via OpenORD (Martin et al., 2011) and\\nForce Atlas 2 (Jacomy et al., 2014). Node colors represent entity communities, shown at two levels\\nof hierarchical clustering: (a) Level 0, corresponding to the hierarchical partition with maximum\\nmodularity, and (b) Level 1, which reveals internal structure within these root-level communities.\\nC\\nContext Window Selection\\nThe effect of context window size on any particular task is unclear, especially for models like\\ngpt-4-turbo with a large context size of 128k tokens. Given the potential for information to\\nbe “lost in the middle” of longer contexts (Kuratov et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2023), we wanted to ex-', 'plore the effects of varying the context window size for our combinations of datasets, questions, and\\nmetrics. In particular, our goal was to determine the optimum context size for our baseline condition\\n(SS) and then use this uniformly for all query-time LLM use. To that end, we tested four context\\nwindow sizes: 8k, 16k, 32k and 64k. Surprisingly, the smallest context window size tested (8k)\\nwas universally better for all comparisons on comprehensiveness (average win rate of 58.1%), while\\nperforming comparably with larger context sizes on diversity (average win rate = 52.4%), and em-\\npowerment (average win rate = 51.3%). Given our preference for more comprehensive and diverse\\nanswers, we therefore used a fixed context window size of 8k tokens for the final evaluation.\\n19', 'D\\nExample Answer Comparison\\nTable 5: Example question, answers, and LLM-generated assessments for the News article dataset.\\nQuestion\\nWhich public figures are repeatedly mentioned across various entertainment articles?\\nGraph\\nRAG\\nThe entertainment industry is vast and diverse, encompassing film, television, music, sports, and\\ndigital media.
